1. I chose to us the Apache 2.0 License. I decided to use this for my random dataset so I can see if people make changes to my file. For example, if the data I uploaded were a class list for the students I TA for, and someone went in to change their first name, I want to have notice of what that change is so I can address the student appropriatley. The apache 2.0 license provides this capability by producing a notice for each file modified.
2. MSU Library recommends DRYAD, Zenodo, and ICPSR for data archiving. These are broken down based on the data type and which repository is best suited for that data. 
3. GitHUB allows people to work on code and workflo at the same time and merge the results together at the end. This makes coding data accesible, and findable to aanyone who wants to use the data as a template or work on the data. Although it does not require data to be uploaded in a machine readable format, many of the files uploaded are in a common format requiring only basic programs to open it. 
4. One advantage of making code widely accesible is other experts can help debug code or help develop workflow. All the benefits of working collaborativley are available by putting data up on GitHub.
5. One disadvatage of make code widely accesible is other people might be able to take credit for your work. They can use your code since it is free and available. While this might help them with their projects, you can also lose credit.
6. I do not have an established Graduate project yet, but I can see how sharing a python code between FEMA product developers would help my engineering firm develop DFIRM product for floodplain maps. If all the firms working on floodplain mapping could work together on developing and writing code and workflow for creating lookup tables, the DFIRM product process could be expedited and standardized for everyone reporting to FEMA.
7. Any information and data collected for rivers and tributaries on private land probably should not be published. Since it is not public land, the data should be kept private unless otherwise stated by the private landowner. This is not related to the code I described above but is related to the data inputs for running the code.
